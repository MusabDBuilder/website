        <h2>What is Science?</h2>
        <p><strong>Science</strong> is the study of the natural world through **observation, experiments, and evidence-based reasoning**. It helps us understand how things work, from tiny atoms to the vast universe.</p>
        <p>Science is divided into different branches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Physics</strong> – The study of forces, motion, energy, and matter.</li>
            <li><strong>Chemistry</strong> – The study of substances, their properties, and how they interact.</li>
            <li><strong>Biology</strong> – The study of living organisms, from bacteria to humans.</li>
            <li><strong>Earth Science</strong> – The study of Earth's structure, climate, and space.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>✔ Chemical Reactions – How substances change</p>
        <p>✔ Acids and Bases – Why lemons are sour and soap feels slippery</p>

        <h3>Biology</h3>
        <p>✔ Cells – The building blocks of life</p>
        <p>✔ Photosynthesis – How plants make their own food</p>
        <p>✔ Human Body Systems – Heart, brain, lungs, and more</p>

        <h3>Earth Science</h3>
        <p>✔ The Solar System – Planets, moons, and the Sun</p>
        <p>✔ Weather and Climate – What makes rain and storms</p>
        <p>✔ Rocks and Minerals – What Earth is made of</p>
