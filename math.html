        <h2>What is Math?</h2>
        <p><strong>Mathematics</strong> is the study of numbers, shapes, patterns, and logical reasoning. It helps us understand and solve real-world problems by using calculations, measurements, and formulas.</p>
        <p>Math is used everywhere in daily life, including <strong>shopping</strong> (calculating prices), <strong>sports</strong> (keeping scores), <strong>science</strong> (measuring distances), and <strong>technology</strong> (programming and design).</p>
        <p>Math is divided into different branches:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Arithmetic</strong> – Basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</li>
            <li><strong>Algebra</strong> – Using symbols and letters to represent numbers in equations.</li>
            <li><strong>Geometry</strong> – Studying shapes, sizes, and angles.</li>
            <li><strong>Statistics</strong> – Collecting and analyzing data to make conclusions.</li>
            <li><strong>Trigonometry</strong> – Studying angles and triangles.</li>
        </ul>
